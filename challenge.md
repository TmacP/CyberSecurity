Welcome to the Audio Steganography CTF! In this challenge, you will be tasked with extracting hidden information from audio files using steganography techniques.

To start, you will be given a file called challenge.zip. This file is encrypted with SHA-256, so you'll need to find the key to unlock it. The key is hidden in a file called flag.wav, which has been encoded using basic LSB (least significant bit) steganography on a WAV file. You can use the provided audiostego.py script to decode the hidden information and retrieve the key.

Once you have the key, you can use it to unlock the challenge.zip file and access the rest of the challenge.

The challenge consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty. Each level will require you to apply different steganography techniques to extract the hidden information from an audio file. Your goal is to solve all levels and find the flag hidden in each one.

To keep track of your progress, we've provided a scoreboard where you can submit your flags and see your rank among other participants. The faster you solve a level, the higher your score will be.

Good luck, and may the best audio steganographer win!

here are some possible challenges for levels 1 to 5:

Level 1:
File name: level1.wav
Challenge: In this level, you'll need to extract a hidden message from the audio file using basic LSB steganography. The message is a simple string of characters. Your goal is to find the message and submit it as the flag.

Level 2:
File name: level2.wav
Challenge: In this level, the audio file has been encrypted using a simple substitution cipher. You'll need to first crack the cipher and then apply basic LSB steganography to extract the hidden message. The message is a short sentence. Your goal is to find the message and submit it as the flag.

Level 3:
File name: level3.wav
Challenge: In this level, the audio file has been encrypted using a more complex cipher. You'll need to first analyze the audio file to determine the cipher used, then decrypt the file and apply advanced steganography techniques to extract the hidden message. The message is a paragraph of text. Your goal is to find the message and submit it as the flag.

Level 4:
File name: level4.wav
Challenge: In this level, the audio file has been split into multiple channels, each containing a different piece of information. You'll need to analyze the channels and apply advanced steganography techniques to extract the hidden message. The message is a file hidden within the audio file. Your goal is to extract the file and submit its contents as the flag.

Level 5:
File name: level5.wav
Challenge: In this level, the audio file not lsb. ...
